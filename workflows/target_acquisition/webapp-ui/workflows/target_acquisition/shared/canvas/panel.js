/**
 * The canvas, as a panel a workflow offers.
 *
 * The framework has no canvas. It runs whatever workflow it is given, and a
 * workflow that never looks at a stage — an analysis, a report, a set of
 * forms — should not be handed one, nor pay for the markup of one. So the
 * canvas is declared here, in the workflow that wants it, and the framework
 * only mounts what it is handed.
 *
 * It belongs to the workflow rather than to any one of its steps. Every step
 * from the carrier onward is looking at the same square millimetre of glass,
 * and the picture of it is one picture: the layers a step contributes are put
 * on the stack this panel holds, and pan, zoom and the transparency dial act
 * on all of them together. That is what makes the layers comparable, and it
 * is why no step owns the canvas.
 *
 * What this file is, precisely, is the panel's shape and the elements in it.
 * What gets drawn in it is `../stage.js`, and what any of it means is the
 * steps'.
